Firewall Simulation by Adrian Costin and Scott Clark
This is a standard java 7 program compiled with netbeans 7.3
It incorporates a GUI so you may have trouble compiling outside of netbeans
However: There is a JAR file awaiting execution in the /dist directory
All source code is available in /src
You may feel free to use the code in /test to generate however many jobs you want to
test in the simulation. Just add the generated text file to /dist and overwrite
If you want to add jobs, block or open ports, add or remove previously determined malicious hashes:
you must stop the system from running with the button to the far left. once you have made you changes,
start the system back up. you can make whatever changes you like before pressing that button.
